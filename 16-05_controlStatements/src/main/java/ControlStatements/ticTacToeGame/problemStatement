 Console-Based Tic-Tac-Toe Game (2 Players)
Design and implement a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game that runs in the console.
The game should allow two users to take turns placing their marks (X and O) on a 3×3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

 Core Requirements:

1)Game Board Representation:
Use a 3×3 matrix (list of lists or a 1D list with index mapping) to represent the board.
Display the board after each move in a user-friendly format.

2)Player Turns:
Player 1 uses X, and Player 2 uses O.
Prompt the current player to enter their move (row and column or position number).
Validate the move:
Ensure the input is within bounds.
Ensure the chosen cell is not already occupied.
If invalid, prompt again without switching turns.

3)Game Loop:
Use a loop to keep the game running until:
A player wins, or
The board is full (draw).
After each move, check for a win or draw condition.

4)Win Conditions:
A player wins if they have three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
Use conditionals to check all possible winning combinations.

5)Draw Condition:
If all cells are filled and no player has won, declare the game a draw.
6)Game Termination:
Use break to exit the game loop when a win or draw is detected.
Display a message announcing the winner or declaring a draw.
