Problem Statement: Login System with Limited Attempts
Design and implement a console-based login system that simulates user authentication with a fixed number of attempts.
The system should validate a username and password combination and restrict access after a certain number of failed attempts.

Core Requirements:
Predefined Credentials:

Store a valid username and password in the program (e.g., username = "admin", password = "1234").
These values can be hardcoded for simplicity.
User Input:

Prompt the user to enter their username and password.
Compare the input with the stored credentials.
Attempt Limitation:

Allow the user only 3 attempts to enter the correct credentials.
After each failed attempt, display a message indicating the number of remaining attempts.
If the user enters the correct credentials, display a success message and exit the loop.
Termination on Failure:

If the user fails to log in after 3 attempts, display an error message and terminate the program using break.
