Server Startup
Imagine you're building a server application that needs to:
1)Load configuration
2)Connect to the database
3)Start the web server
Only after all 3 tasks complete, should the main server say: "Startup complete".

Using CountDownLatch:
Each task runs in its own thread.
The main thread waits using latch.await().
Each task calls latch.countDown() when done.
When all 3 tasks are complete, the main thread continues.
