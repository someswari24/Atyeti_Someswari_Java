Reading Content from URL
------------------------
To read content from a URL, we will use “/” URL in our example:

public void givenURLName_whenUsingURL_thenFileData() {
    String expectedData = "Baeldung";

    URL urlObject = new URL("/");
    URLConnection urlConnection = urlObject.openConnection();
    InputStream inputStream = urlConnection.getInputStream();
    String data = readFromInputStream(inputStream);

    Assert.assertThat(data, containsString(expectedData));
}

There are also alternative ways of connecting to a URL.
Here we used the URL and URLConnection class available in the standard SDK.

Note:-If you read data from a URL using file handling techniques in most programming languages (like Python,Java),
it typically returns the raw content of the resource at that URL.For a standard web page, this means you'll get the HTML source code.
