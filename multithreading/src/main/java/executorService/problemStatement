Problem:
You are developing a web crawler that needs to fetch and process data from 1,000 URLs.

Design a solution using ExecutorService where:
A fixed thread pool is used to manage concurrent HTTP requests.
Each thread fetches the content of a URL and extracts the title of the webpage.
The titles are collected and stored in a shared collection (e.g., ConcurrentLinkedQueue or List with proper synchronization).

Additional Requirement:
Ensure the thread pool shuts down gracefully after all URLs are processed, and handle timeouts or failed requests using Future.
