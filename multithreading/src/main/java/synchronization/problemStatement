Problem Statement: Printer Queue Synchronization
You are designing a shared printer queue system for a small office.
Multiple employees (represented as threads) want to send print jobs to a shared printer.

Requirements:

Only one thread at a time should access the printer to print a document.

If multiple threads try to print at the same time, they should wait for their turn (no two print jobs should overlap).

Simulate the print job by making the thread sleep for a few seconds (e.g., Thread.sleep(2000)).

Ensure thread safety using synchronization.
