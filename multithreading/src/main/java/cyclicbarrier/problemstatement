Data Aggregation with CyclicBarrier
You are tasked with building a multi-threaded data aggregation system for a weather monitoring station.
The station has three sensors:
1.Temperature Sensor
2.Wind Speed Sensor
3.Rainfall Sensor

Each sensor runs in a separate thread and periodically collects data.
After all three sensors have reported their readings, the system should aggregate the data and print the summary
(e.g., "Summary: Temp=30°C, Wind=15 km/h, Rain=2 mm").

Requirements:
Use a CyclicBarrier to ensure that all sensor threads wait until every sensor has provided its reading before generating the summary.

After printing the summary, the sensors should proceed to collect the next round of data (i.e., barrier resets — showing CyclicBarrier's cyclic nature).

Simulate at least 3 cycles of data collection.

Hints
Create 3 threads, one per sensor.
Each thread generates random data for its sensor.
CyclicBarrier's barrier action should aggregate and print the data.
Use Thread.sleep() to simulate sensor delay.
