CYCLIC BARRIER
--------------
A CyclicBarrier is a synchronization aid that allows a set of threads to all wait for each other to reach a common barrier point.
Once all threads have reached the barrier, they can proceed with their execution.What sets the CyclicBarrier apart
from other synchronization mechanisms like CountDownLatch is its ability to reset and be reused after the barrier is tripped.
