Problem:
You are given a large integer array containing 100 million elements.
Your task is to compute the sum of all elements in this array as efficiently as possible by leveraging parallel processing.

Design and implement a solution using the Fork/Join Framework where:
The array is recursively divided into smaller subarrays until the subarray size falls below a threshold (e.g., 10,000 elements).
The sum of each subarray is computed sequentially when below the threshold.
The partial sums from subtasks are combined to compute the final total sum.

Additional Requirement:
Compare the performance of your Fork/Join implementation with a sequential approach (single-threaded loop sum).
