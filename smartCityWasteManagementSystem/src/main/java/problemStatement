Problem Statement: "SmartCity Waste Management System"
Objective:
Design and implement a Java application that simulates a smart city's waste management system. The system should read data from a file,
process it using collections and streams, handle exceptions gracefully, and generate a report.

Scenario:
The city collects daily waste data from various zones. Each record contains:
Zone ID
Date
Waste Type (Plastic, Organic, E-Waste, etc.)
Weight (in kg)
The data is stored in a CSV file named waste_data.csv.

Requirements:
File Handling:
Read the CSV file and parse each line into a WasteRecord object.
Handle file not found, malformed data, and IO exceptions.

Collections:
Store the records in a suitable collection (e.g., List<WasteRecord>).
Use a Map<String, List<WasteRecord>> to group records by zone.

Streams:
Calculate total waste per zone.
Find the zone with the highest plastic waste.
Generate a summary of average waste per type across all zones.

Exception Handling:
Create custom exceptions like InvalidWasteDataException.
Handle and log errors without stopping the program.

Output:
Write a report to a file waste_report.txt with:
Total waste per zone
Zone with highest plastic waste
Average waste per type
