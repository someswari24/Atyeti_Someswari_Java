Problem: University Course Management System

Design a system to manage university courses, students, and enrollments using proper use of variables.
Requirements:
1. Class: Course
Instance Variables:courseId (String),courseName (String),maxStudents (int),enrolledStudents (int)
Static Variable:totalCourses (int) — tracks how many courses have been created
Final Variable:UNIVERSITY_NAME (String) — set to "Global University"
Constructor: Initializes course details and increments totalCourses
Method: enrollStudent() — increases enrolledStudents if not full
2. Class: Student
Instance Variables:studentId (String),studentName (String)
Static Variable:studentCount — auto-incremented ID generator
Constructor: Assigns unique ID using studentCount
3. Class: EnrollmentManager
Method: enroll(Student student, Course course)
Parameters: Student, Course
Local Variables: Use to check if enrollment is possible
Print success or failure message

Expected Output Example:
Course Created: CS101 - Data Structures
Course Created: MA101 - Calculus
Student Registered: Alice (ID: S001)
Student Registered: Bob (ID: S002)
Enrolling Alice in CS101... Success!
Enrolling Bob in CS101... Success!
Total Courses: 2
University: Global University
