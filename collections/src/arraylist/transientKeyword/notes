What is transient in Java?

It's used to prevent a variable from being serialized when an object is written to a stream (i.e., saved to a file or sent over a network).

Why use transient?
1. Security / Privacy
      Example: Passwords, bank PINs, or secret keys.
      When serialized, the password field will not be saved.
      Upon deserialization, it will be null (default value for String).

 ## transient vs static
 static fields belong to the class, not the object.
Serialization only works on object fields, so static fields are never serialized, even if not marked transient.
Using transient static has no effect, but it compiles fine.

##transient vs final
final variables are constants, their values are serialized directly.
Marking a final variable as transient is useless â€” again, compiles fine, but has no practical effect.
