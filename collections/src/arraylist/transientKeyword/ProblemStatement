Problem Statement:
You are building a system that saves user session data to a file. The session includes sensitive information like a password,
which should not be saved when the object is serialized.

Implement a UserSession class that:

Stores username and password.
Uses the transient keyword to prevent the password from being serialized.
Demonstrates serialization and deserialization to show that the password is not saved.
