Internal Working of ArrayList in Java
=======================================

ArrayList is a resizable array implementation in Java.
ArrayList grows dynamically and ensures that there is always a space to add elements.
The backing data structure of ArrayList is an array of Object classes.
ArrayList class in Java has 3 constructors.
It has its own version of readObject and writeObject methods.

Object Array in ArrayList is transient.
---------------------------------------
EX:Suppose you create an ArrayList with capacity 10 but add only 2 elements.
If elementData were not transient,then all 10 slots (8 of them being null) would be serialized unnecessarily.
That wastes memory and makes serialization slower.
