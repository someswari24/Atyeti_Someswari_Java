How can you make an ArrayList thread-safe?

we can make arraylist thread safe :
                    1)By using Collections.synchronizedList()
                    2)By using CopyOnWriteArrayList

When to Use What?

Use **Collections.synchronizedList** when:
1)You need frequent writes (add/remove).
2)You can synchronize explicitly during iteration.

Use **CopyOnWriteArrayList** when:
1)You have many threads reading and rare modifications.
2)You want safe iteration without needing synchronization.

Implications of Using ArrayList in a Multithreaded Environment
--------------------------------------------------------------
ArrayList is not synchronized, which means:

1)Race Conditions:
If multiple threads modify (e.g., add/remove elements) concurrently, data corruption or unexpected behavior can occur.
Example: One thread resizing the internal array while another is adding an element can cause ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

2)Visibility Issues:
One thread might not see the updated list state if another thread modifies it due to lack of proper memory synchronization.

3)Iterators Are Not Fail-Safe:
Iterating while modifying the list from another thread leads to ConcurrentModificationException.


why do we have to make our array list Thread Safe?

We need to make an ArrayList thread-safe in Java when it is accessed or modified by multiple threads concurrently,
to avoid data inconsistency, runtime exceptions, and unexpected behavior.

When to Make ArrayList Thread-Safe?

You must make an ArrayList thread-safe when:
1)Multiple threads write to the list.
2)A thread reads while another thread modifies it.
3)The list is shared between threads and is not read-only.

You do not need thread safety if:
1)The list is confined to a single thread.
2)You only read from the list after construction (immutable usage).
