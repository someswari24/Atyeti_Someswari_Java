Problem Statement: File Encryption and Decryption
Objective:
Develop a Python script that can encrypt the contents of a text file using a
simple cipher (e.g., Caesar cipher or XOR cipher), and then decrypt it back to its original form.

Requirements:
Input:A plain text file (e.g., sample_input.txt) containing readable text.

Encryption:
Read the content of the file.
Apply a simple encryption algorithm:
Caesar Cipher: Shift each character by a fixed number of positions in the ASCII table.
XOR Cipher: XOR each character with a key.
Save the encrypted content to a new file (e.g., encrypted.txt).

Decryption:
Read the encrypted file.
Apply the reverse of the encryption algorithm to retrieve the original content.
Save the decrypted content to another file (e.g., decrypted.txt).

Validation:
Ensure that the decrypted file content matches the original input file content.

Bonus Features (Optional):
Allow the user to choose the encryption method (Caesar or XOR).
Allow the user to specify the encryption key or shift value.
Add a simple menu-driven interface for encryption and decryption.
