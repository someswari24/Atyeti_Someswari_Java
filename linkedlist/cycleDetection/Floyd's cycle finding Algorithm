Floyd's cycle finding algorithm
=================================
Floyd's cycle algorithm is a pointer algorithm that uses only two pointers,
moving through the sequence at different speeds.
This algorithm is used to find a loop in a linked list.
It uses two pointers one moving twice as fast as the other one.
The faster one is called the fast pointer and the other one is called the slow pointer.

How It Works
------------
Use two pointers:
slow pointer moves 1 step at a time.
fast pointer moves 2 steps at a time.
Start both from the head of the list.

While traversing:
If fast becomes NULL, no cycle exists.
If slow and fast meet at any point, a cycle exists.

Why It Works
-------------
When slow enters the cycle, fast is already inside.
With each iteration, the distance between them increases by 1.
Since they move in a cycle, the distance eventually wraps around, causing them to meet within the loop.
